                <h4>Surf Router</h4>
                <p class="text">
                    Surf Router is a suite of Polymer web components that allows routing user interface elements. It draws many design cues from the AngularJS ui-router.
                </p>
                <h4>Features</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>Resolve data before route loads</li>
                    <li>Apply animation/transitions to elements when the state is activated or deactivated</li>
                    <li>Lazily load imports to reduce application boot time</li>
                </ul>
                <h4>Design Goals</h4>
                <p class="text">
                    Polymer components can either be downloaded/imported and upgraded on the initial page load, or can be dynamically imported as they are needed.
                    While the latter results in a faster initial page load, it can affect the responsiveness of the application since a route change may result in a download to import the new elements.<br/>
                </p>
                <p class="text">
                    Loading all elements upfront will prevent this, and allows more efficient compaction through vulcanization.
                    However, in a large application may take an unacceptable amount of time to process all of the elements.
                    Additionally, there may be portions of the application that are rarely used - downloading, importing, and processing are unnecessary.
                </p>
                <p class="text">
                    A major design goal of surf-router is to enable the developer to choose which elements should be loaded upfront or dynamically.<br/>
                    For example, elements on the critical path can be loaded on-page load, and lesser used elements dynamically.
