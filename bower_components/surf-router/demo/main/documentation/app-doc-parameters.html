                <p>
                Surf Router is a suite of Polymer web components that allows routing user interface elements. It draws many design cues from the AngularJS ui-router.
                </p>

                <h4>Design Goals</h4>
                <p>
                    Polymer components can either be <strong>downloaded/imported and upgraded on the initial page load</strong>, or can be <strong>dynamically imported as they are needed</strong>.
                    While the latter results in a faster initial page load, it can affect the responsiveness of the application since a route change may result in a download to import the new elements.
                    Loading all elements upfront will prevent this, and allows more efficient compaction through vulcanization.
                    However, in <strong>a large application may take an unacceptable amount of time to process all of the elements</strong>.
                    Additionally, there may be portions of the application that are rarely used - downloading, importing, and processing are unnecessary.
                    A major design goal of surf-router is to <strong>enable the developer to choose which elements should be loaded upfront or dynamically</strong>.
                    For example, elements on the critical path can be loaded on-page load, and lesser used elements dynamically.
                </p>
                <h4>Getting Started</h4>
                <p>
                    All surf-router apps should start with a root element that will contain the rest of your application.
                    This element should have a <i>routes</i> object that contains all of the routes/pages in your app.

                    See <route-link state="main.doc.parameters">route parameters</route-link> for all of the options in a route, but
                    very basic example is as follows:
                </p>
