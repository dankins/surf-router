                    All surf-router apps start with a root element that will contain the rest of your application.
                    This element has a <i>routes</i> object that contains all of the routes/pages in your app.
                </p>
                <p>
                    A very basic example is as follows, but look at the <a href="https://github.com/surfapp/surf-router/tree/gh-pages">source code</a>
                    for a more complete example.
                </p>

                <h3>HTML5 Mode</h3>
                <p>
                    The routes object is a nested object that represents all of the available states in your application.
                    If you would like your URLs to be in "HTML5 mode" then set the base url to the empty string "".
                    This will result in URLs like the following:
                </p>
                <blockquote>
                    http://foo/bar/baz
                </blockquote>
                <p>
                    For URLs that generally require less configuration on the server end, set the root URL to "#".
                    This will result in URLs like the following:
                </p>
                <blockquote>
                    http://foo/#/bar/baz
                </blockquote>

                <h3>Containers</h3>
                <p>
                    Each route state has a "container" property the determines the type of HTML element that will be displayed for that route.
                    This will likely be a custom element you have created.
                    Any child states will be displayed under the &lt;content&gt;&lt;/content&gt; element in the template.
                </p>
                <p>
                    If the container property is not specified then a "surf-route-abstract" element will be used - which is just an empty template that will hold any child routes.
                </p>
                <h3>Imports</h3>
                <p>
                    The element used for the container may not have been registered and upgraded at the time the state is activated.
                    The "imports" property is used to specify which files should be loaded before the state is activated.
                    The value can be either a string containing a single file path or an array of files to import.
                </p>
                <p>

                    The time the imports are loaded can be configured. For example, you may want to load critical-path elements on page-load or wait to load them until the route is actually activated.
                    This lets you balance initial page load times vs application responsiveness.
                    See <route-link state="docs.lazyloading">Lazy Loading</route-link> for more information.
